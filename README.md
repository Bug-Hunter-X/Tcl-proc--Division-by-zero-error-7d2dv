# Tcl proc: Division by zero error
This repository contains a Tcl procedure with a potential division by zero error and its solution.
The original code in `bug.tcl` demonstrates a scenario where a zero value causes an error.
The solution in `bugSolution.tcl` includes error handling to gracefully manage such situations. 
This example illustrates the importance of proper error handling in Tcl programming to avoid unexpected crashes.
